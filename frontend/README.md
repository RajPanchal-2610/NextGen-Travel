# NextGen Travel - Frontend

This folder contains the frontend code for the **NextGen Travel** application, built to deliver a seamless user experience for travel planning and booking. The frontend is responsible for user interaction and interfaces, including travel buddy matching, destination previews, weather forecasts, and more.

## Project Structure

The frontend code is organized into the following main folders:

- **components/**: Contains reusable components for the UI, such as buttons, forms, and navigation.
- **pages/**: Defines the main pages and views (e.g., Home, Destination Details, Search Results).
- **assets/**: Stores static files such as images, icons, and CSS styles.
- **services/**: Contains API service functions to interact with the backend.
- **utils/**: Utility functions to handle date formatting, input validation, and other helper tasks.

## Features

The NextGen Travel frontend offers the following core features:

1. **Travel Buddy Matching**: Allows users to find travel companions based on tour dates and plans.
2. **360-Degree Destination View**: Provides an immersive, virtual preview of travel destinations.
3. **Weather Forecast**: Displays real-time weather information for selected travel dates.
4. **Tour Reviews and Ratings**: Allows users to submit reviews and rate their travel experiences.
5. **Search Functionality**: Enables users to search for tours by state, distance, and group size.
6. **User Profile Management**: Allows users to update personal information and view past bookings.
